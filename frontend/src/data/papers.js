      title: "Generative Adversarial Networks",
      authors: ["Ian J. Goodfellow", "Jean Pouget-Abadie", "Mehdi Mirza", "Bing Xu", "David Warde-Farley", "Sherjil Ozair", "Aaron Courville", "Yoshua Bengio"],
      year: 2014,
      venue: "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems",
      abstract: "We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G.",

      title: "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition",
      authors: ["Kaiming He", "Xiangyu Zhang", "Shaoqing Ren", "Jian Sun"],
      year: 2015,
      venue: "IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition",
      abstract: "Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions.",

      title: "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding",
      authors: ["Jacob Devlin", "Ming-Wei Chang", "Kenton Lee", "Kristina Toutanova"],
      year: 2018,
      venue: "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics",
      abstract: "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers.",

      title: "Attention Is All You Need",
      authors: ["Ashish Vaswani", "Noam Shazeer", "Niki Parmar", "Jakob Uszkoreit", "Llion Jones", "Aidan N. Gomez", "≈Åukasz Kaiser", "Illia Polosukhin"],
      year: 2017,
      venue: "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems",
      abstract: "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely.",
